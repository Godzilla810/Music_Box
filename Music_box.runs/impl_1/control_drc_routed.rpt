2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net sta1/led_OBUF[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin sta1/led_OBUF[0]_inst_i_1/O, cell sta1/led_OBUF[0]_inst_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net sta1/state_inferred__0/i__n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin sta1/state_inferred__0/i_/O, cell sta1/state_inferred__0/i_. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>
